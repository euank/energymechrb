# Energymechrb

An Energymech parser specializing in the ZNC Log format. See also [irc-log-parser-ruby](https://github.com/shunirr/irc-log-parser-ruby).

In my old age, I forgot that the previous library existed when I implemented this. This is more specialized and handles more znc usecases. It has also been battle hardened on a large input already.
